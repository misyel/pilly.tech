			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<h2> Hello! Welcome to pilly, your virtual pharmacist. </h2>
			<p>
				Pilly is an app that is created to help serve better connections between the clients and the pharmacies. There are several services provided to enhance the experiences for the clients such as easier medication refill, a personal reminder for medication intake, a time-saving method with notifications that alert clients once their medications are ready, and a new voice technology (Pilly) that creates an easier control for the users towards our app especially towards many elderly. Not only useful for the clients, but it also serves as a new platform for many local pharmacies with easier preparation of medications. </p>
			<h3> Introducing Pilly: Easier way for medication, A Healthy Life = A Happy Life. </h3>
